AWS recently introduced Bucket owner enforced ACL mode.

Fix: Enable ACLs

Go to your bucket → Permissions tab

Scroll to Object Ownership

Click Edit

If it says:

❌ Object Ownership: Bucket owner enforced (ACLs disabled)

Then change it to:

✔ ACLs enabled → Object writer

Save changes

Now go back to Objects → Actions

“Make public using ACL” will be enabled




After making it public, scroll down to Object URL

You will see something like:

https://<your-bucket>.s3.amazonaws.com/sample.txt


Copy this URL

Paste it in your browser → the file should open
(For images it will display, for text it will download or preview)
